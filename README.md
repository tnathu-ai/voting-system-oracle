<summary><b>ðŸ“© Detailed Introduction</b></summary>
<p>

The AEC is dedicated to offering Australians an independent electoral service. While ensuring integrity, accuracy, and transparency, the current manual voting system has its challenges. This project aims to transition to a computerised voting system for federal elections, addressing concerns like time efficiency, resource allocation, and environmental impact.

## Project Scope
This project's initial phase focuses on federal general elections for the House of Representatives. The following are out of scope:
Senate federal general elections:
+ Federal by-elections
+ State and territory elections
+ City and Shire Council elections
+ Referendums
+ Other AEC services

## Important Notes
Ballot vs Issuance Record: The Ballot is the digital equivalent of the ballot paper. It captures voters' preferences but cannot be associated with any voter. The Issuance Record, on the other hand, records when and where a ballot is issued to a specific voter. It tracks who has voted but should not be used to track down the ballot issued and cast by a specific voter.
Informal Ballots: The database should accommodate both formal and informal ballots. Informal ballots should be identified and eliminated from the counting process. A formal ballot must have a preference cast for each candidate. If there are n candidates, they must be numbered from 1 to n.

<summary><b>ðŸ“‹ Oracle SQL Database Setup Instructions</b></summary>
<p>

We've taken the liberty to pre-populate the database for you! :tada: If you face any issues like no data or data loss in the Oracle database, don't panic. Just follow these steps:

1. Run the script `DDL_script.ddl`
2. Run the script `insert_as4.sql`

### **Pre-Requisites**
Before diving in, ensure you have:
- Oracle SQL Server up and running :rocket:
- User role with permissions to create and modify tables :shield:

### **Let's Understand the Data Structure**

#### **Party Table**
- Contains info on political parties.
- Parties included:
  * Liberal Democrats (LDP)
  * Australian Labor Party (ALP)
  * ... and many more!

#### **Electorate Table**
- Houses electorate details.
- For example, `Hotham` electorate has:
  * Historical date: January 1, 2023
  * 50,000 historical voters
  * Placeholder for the current MP

#### **Election Table**
- Info on each election.
- Two federal elections predefined for `Hotham` and `Melbourne` on May 21, 2022.

#### **Voter Table**
- Voter registration details.
- Voters like `Joe Bloggs` and `Penny Chan` are predefined!

#### **Candidate Table**
- Data of election candidates.
- Examples:
  * Edward SOK from LDP in Hotham
  * Clare O'NEIL from ALP in Hotham

#### **Election Event Table**
- Contains election-specific events.
- Events predefined for both `Hotham` and `Melbourne`.

#### **Ballot Issuance Table**
- Note: No predefined data here as per requirements.

### **Implementation**

Use the SQL statements in `insert_as4.sql` to insert the above data. Remember to execute in the order mentioned above to ensure data integrity. Once done, you're all set to query or manipulate the data as you see fit!
