# Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Computerized Voting System

## Introduction
The AEC is dedicated to offering Australians an independent electoral service. While ensuring integrity, accuracy, and transparency, the current manual voting system has its challenges. This project aims to transition to a computerised voting system for federal elections, addressing concerns like time efficiency, resource allocation, and environmental impact.

## Development Tools
+ Database Management: Oracle Developer
+ Design: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for logical and relational design
