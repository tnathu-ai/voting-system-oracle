# Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Computerized Voting System

## Introduction
The AEC is dedicated to offering Australians an independent electoral service. While ensuring integrity, accuracy, and transparency, the current manual voting system has its challenges. This project aims to transition to a computerised voting system for federal elections, addressing concerns like time efficiency, resource allocation, and environmental impact.

## Development Tools
We will use Oracle Developer for database management and development for this project. The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) will be used for logical and relational design, ensuring a clear representation of the database structure. Once the ERD is finalised, it will be used to generate the Data Definition Language (DDL) code, streamlining the database creation process.

## Project Scope
This project's initial phase focuses on federal general elections for the House of Representatives. The following are out of scope:
Senate federal general elections:
+ Federal by-elections
+ State and territory elections
+ City and Shire Council elections
+ Referendums
+ Other AEC services
